## Introduction

This project serves to better understand the organizational behavior of higher education institutes (HEIs). Recent advances in organizational behavior theory have shed light on the notion of coevolution of organizations -- how do the policies and routines of an organization evolve with an ever-evolving customer base? By leveraging an agent-based modeling paradigm, insights regarding instiutional policies can be gleaned from simulation.
